Quick and dirty Vine Video Search and Scraper - Ver.1.1 dP

This is based off another project by mxtte but had a few errors when outputting the scrapped data.

Original issuses from mxtte project:
- Scrapped links to "Vine.co/v/12345678910" included a "#" in ending link. "#" removed.
- Scrapped vine links included duplicates if not more. Fixed. 

I also included proper vine embed output of the videos.

This is still dirty but it works now.
